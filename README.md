# Scrum Story Point Voter

### Summary
This is a Scrum tool for voting on story points. When visiting the URL from a desktop, you can see results and control aspects of the session. When visiting from a mobile site, you can vote.

### Desktop
On one computer, set up the room by using the following URL with a unique room name added to the end:  
https://murmuring-earth-50512.herokuapp.com/  
Example: https://murmuring-earth-50512.herokuapp.com/MyRoom1  

From the desktop site you can see the tally of all votes, the vote with the highest representation, and reset all the votes.

### Mobile
On mobile, visit the same URL (shortened URL and QR code provided on the desktop site). You will see a button for each story point. Use the buttons to vote and see your results show up on the desktop site.
